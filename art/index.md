I'm an artist based in Birmingham, UK. I work mostly with cameras and images but I'm not really a photographer. Or maybe I am. What is photography anyway?

[I archive my work on Github](https://github.com/peteash10/Artworks) where you can find documentation and, where relevant, source materials and code. 

## BOM Fellowship

Most of my work is anchored by my [fellowship](http://www.bom.org.uk/bom-fellows/) at [Birmingham Open Media](http://www.bom.org.uk/) where I have been based since it opened in November 2014. 

This work is currently being [developed on Github](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work) and will start taking shape through 2017. 

During 2016 my fellowship work was mostly a sabatical based around [Speculative Cameras](https://github.com/peteash10/Artworks/blob/master/Speculative%20Cameras/ReadMe.md), rethinking the camera as an artistic tool. I introduced it at a [Fellows talk](https://vimeo.com/159868781) in March.

## Major Uncommissioned Works

I like to be always making new work. These are a small number of pieces that I'm pleased with or which resonated with others.
