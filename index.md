## CV

I'm a self-employed freelance artist practitioner. If you would like to hire me on that basis (or on some other basis - I'm not too fussy) [here is my CV](http://art.peteashton.com/cv/).

## Art

[My art portfolio site](http://art.peteashton.com) has my main works with documentation.

## Blog & Newsletter

I've been blogging since 2000 and currently maintain a chronological web-based journal of my life and interests at [blog.peteashton.com](http://blog.peteashton.com).

I send a "what Pete's up to" email out every so often. [Subscribe here.](https://tinyletter.com/peteashton)

## Events

[A list of all the events](http://peteashton.com/events/) I'm running, am involved with or want you to know I'm attending.

## Workshops and Talks

[I run workshops on photography and technology](http://peteashton.com/workshops/) which you can commission me to run. 

I do a fair amount of public speaking. [Here's a few talks I actually remembered to record.](http://peteashton.com/talks/)

## Projects

I'm involved in various things, often with other people. 

-	[Photo School](http://photo-school.co.uk) - Teaching photography and running photo walks in Birmingham.

-	[Bunminster Fuller & co](http://bunminster.uk) - Fiona and I keep rabbits and had started documenting everything we know on this website.   

## Photography

I still put my fancy photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/) because where else is there? If you want to use my photos, for free or for a fee, [here are my wishes](http://peteashton.com/photography_usage).
