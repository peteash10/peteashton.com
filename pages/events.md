Here's a list of upcoming things I'm either running, am involved with or want you to know I'm attending.

**For photography events** related to Photo School, [see the latest newsletter](https://us2.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=7831fcef470b0e8f86ec0af40&id=9a536a32c0).

## Art Events

June 16: [**Open Zine Archive**](https://www.crosscityzine.org/oza) at [Artefact](http://artefactstirchley.co.uk), Stirchley. All my zines and small press comics from the 1990s will be on display, curated by the [Cross City Zine](https://www.crosscityzine.org/) editors who, as young zinesters, will be trying to make sense of them.

July 27-29: [**Birmingham Camera Obscura**](http://bhamobscura.com) at the [Lunar Festival](http://lunarfestival.co.uk).

September 8 / 15: **Photo Walk**. I'll be running two new walks in the Jewellery Quarter comissioned for [Birmingham Heritage Week](http://birminghamheritageweek.co.uk).

October 9: **Crit Club** at Vivid Projects. As a [Black Hole Club](http://www.blackholeclub.com) member I'll be talking about my practice and presenting new work to the public and my peers to gain critical feedback. All are welcome, especially my peers. My mother will hopefully also be in attendance, though probably not on stage.  

Sept - Nov: [**Rivers of the World**](http://riversoftheworld.org) exhibtion touring London, Exeter and Worcester, featuring work produced by me with Worcestershire pupils. 

I don't have a lot of art-related events scheduled at the moment - am mostly head down writing. But if you'd like to employ me to [do a talk](http://peteashton.com/talks/), [run a workshop](http://peteashton.com/workshops/), or something else on my [CV](http://art.peteashton.com/cv/), please get in touch!
