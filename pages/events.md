## Art Events

June 12: [**Interrogang**](https://twitter.com/theinterrogang). I'll be leading a discussion on the role of artists in exploring issues related to data by using [Golan Levin's talk to Google engineers](https://youtu.be/klDEgdUYiIE) as our framing. All are welcome.

All my zines and small press comics from the 1990s will be on display, curated by the [Cross City Zine](https://www.crosscityzine.org/) editors who, as young zinesters, will be trying to make sense of them. Jez Higgins and myself, who were there at the time, will be on hand. 

June 29 - July 6: **Another Dimension** - I have an installation in the next group show by Black Hole Club members at [Vivid Projects](http://www.vividprojects.org.uk), Digbeth. "Reflecting on ways in which optical illusions alter how we perceive the real, physical world."

As a [Black Hole Club](http://www.blackholeclub.com) member I'll be talking about my practice and presenting new work to the public and my peers to gain critical feedback. All are welcome, especially my peers. My mother will hopefully also be in attendance, though probably not on stage.
