Here's a list of upcoming things I'm either running, am involved with or want you to know I'm attending.

**For photography events** related to Photo School, [see the latest newsletter](https://us2.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=7831fcef470b0e8f86ec0af40&id=9a536a32c0).

**Art Events**

May 5th: [AI for Artists](http://art-ai.dmu.ac.uk/event/ai-for-artists) workshop at the Art & AI Festival, Phoenix Arts Centre, Leicester. Free - [book here](https://www.phoenix.org.uk/event/ai-for-artists/).

Sept - Nov: [Rivers of the World](http://riversoftheworld.org) exhibtion touring London, Exeter and Worcester, featuring work produced by me with Worcestershire pupils. 

I don't have a lot of art-related events scheduled at the moment - am mostly head down writing. But if you'd like to employ me to do a talk or [run a workshop](http://peteashton.com/workshops/), please get in touch!
