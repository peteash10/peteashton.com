I'm an artist based in Birmingham in the North West of Europe. My work centers on cameras as post-photographic data-capture devices with an interest in realising their output through mechanical/human gesture.

[I've started to develop and archive my work on Github](https://github.com/peteash10/Artworks) where you can find documentation and, where relevant, source materials and code. 

## New work for 2017

Throughout 2017 I will be producing a new body of work culminating in a solo show in November. [The work is being developed and documented here.](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work)
