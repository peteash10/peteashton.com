**Stirchley Salon** is a new, regular event to be held at [Artefact Projects](http://artefactstirchley.co.uk) where artists and makers are invited to talk about their work to an audience of peers and interested persons. 

The format is friendly and informal with questions and comments welcome. Think of it less as a presentation, more as a conversation framed and directed by the artists work. 

Speakers should be able to talk about an aspect of their practice or a particular piece of work for 10-15 minutes and be willing to answer questions for another 15. Discussions will be moderated for relevance and diversity of voices but otherwise left to freewheel. 

Each salon which will last 90 minutes including a break and feature two artists or makers. 

Stirchley Salon is run by [Pete Ashton](http://art.peteashton.com) with the long term goal of being self-sustaining and run by the local community. 

If you would like to speak at a the first few salons, starting late summer / early autumn 2018, please email pete@peteashton.com
