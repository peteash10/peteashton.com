## Artificial Intelligence

Such a broad subject and so much to cover. This is the basis of my show [Instructions for Humans at Birmingham Open Media](http://www.bom.org.uk/event/instructions-for-humans/) next month where I'll be in the gallery every day (Wed - Sat, 12-5) so if you'd like to discuss it further please come visit. I will also be gathering more resources at [instructionsforhumans.com](http://instructionsforhumans.com) once the show starts.

[Deep Dream Generator](https://deepdreamgenerator.com) is the tool we used to turn the group portrait into slugs and puppies. There are also options for "Style Transfer" which we didn't look at. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream)

[Gene Kogan](http://genekogan.com) is the go-to guy for using AI and machine learning for art. His book-in-progress with Francis Tseng is online with lots of examples at [ml4a.github.io](http://ml4a.github.io). Here's the short presentation I played you: [What Neural Networks See](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai/what-neural-nets-see).

[Memo Akten](http://www.memo.tv) currently developing new work using AI systems and is worth keeping an eye on. Something good will emerge from his brain, I'm sure. 

## And that's it! 

Thank you again for coming and hope to see you at BOM in the Autumn.
