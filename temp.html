<p><strong>Echo Edit</strong> was my first piece of public performance art. In recent years I've become interested with performance art, mostly because I don't understand it and find some of it impenetrable and uncomfortable. For this reason I think integrating it into my own practice somehow will be useful, possibly in the same way I found hanging around with sound artists made me think about photography (light art, if you like) in new and exciting ways. </p>

<p>There are a few key artists and works I've seen over the years which have led to this. </p>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/can_labs/transcranial/">Transcranial</a>, a trio of pieces by Klaus Obermaier, Daito Manabe and Kyle McDonald, which I saw performed at the <a href="http://resonate.io/2015/projects/transcranial/">Resonate festival in 2015</a>, was all about the live collaboration between dancer/performers on stage and programmers in the wings with each reacting to the other. For Klaus Obermaier's section a video feed of the dancers is fed through algorithmic processes and projected onto the stage. The dancers can then &quot;play&quot; the algorithms by altering their movements, while Klaus tweaks or switches the algorithms to &quot;play&quot; the dancers. Equilibrium is found and lost as the performance plays out. </p>

<p><a href="https://emily-warner.com">Emily Warner</a> was one of the other artists on the <a href="http://art.peteashton.com/goodbye-wittgenstein/">Goodbye Wittgenstien</a> residency in Austria last year and is exactly the sort of performance artist that confuses the hell out of me, though I do enjoy her work a lot. Working alongside her for that month was really illuminating and our conversations have led to her being one of the main collaborators for <a href="http://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/">Instructions for Humans</a>. Mostly it's the procedural, ritualised nature of her work and how she responds to a space or object with movement. I see parallels to the act of photography, which is really interesting. </p>

<p>This year, again at Resonate, I got onto a workshop with <a href="http://sicchio.com">Kate Sicchio</a>, a dance choreographer and tech-artist who has connections to the live-coding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave">Algorave</a> scene. One of her pieces, <a href="http://blog.sicchio.com/works/hacking-choreography/">Hacking Choreography</a>, sees her use a huma-readable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a> to give instructions to dancers, defining moves and setting &quot;if-then&quot; loops. Other than the insight into choreography and scoring movement, it was good to get a sense of how the human performer relates to the process and the freedom of interpretation they have. The work is not scored in the sense of an orchestral score where players (within reason) have to do as they're told, bu scored in a more suggestive way, creating a dialogue through the code and their response to it. In other words, the dancers can ignore their instructions, which is as valid a feedback signal as obeying them perfectly. </p>

<p>Memo Akten's <a href="https://medium.com/@memoakten/shm12-science-technology-culture-tradition-6c45e2249afb">Simple Harmonic Motion #12</a> was a performance piece commissioned for the Future Everything festival in Manchester which I saw in 2015. A row of 16 percussionists played a simple rhythmic piece which fell in and out of phase (a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_Music">Steve Reich's Pendulum Music</a>). Each player was responding to a click-track playing in their ear which they had to replicate. Obviously some made errors, which gave what could have been a rigid, militaristic piece a sense of organic humanity. I really liked the use of humans as meat-circuits in a mechanical system and the requirement that they not be perfect. (Memo has recently been <a href="http://www.memo.tv/learning-to-see/">developing work</a> using machine learning and computer perception so the thread from the SHM series is nice to explore.)</p>

<p>Obviously there's more to each of these than the sliver I'm highlighting here for my personal use and I'd recommend exploring them further. And there were other people and things along the way, which I'll doubtless remember once this is posted, but you get the idea.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<p>The purpose of <strong>Echo Edit</strong> was to force myself to be a performance artist so I could work with performance artists more collaboratively. If I am asking them to come into my world of data-art then I need to go into their world of physical movement. This is not something I find comfortable. While I do certainly use gesture and movement in my work (from gesticulating while teaching to the physical contortions needed to get that specific photograph) consciously making gestures without literal value feels very weird to me. When I dance it's not deliberative or performative. It's just dancing. This would be movement on purpose with no purpose. Weirdness. </p>

<p>I had put myself in a similar position on the <a href="http://art.peteashton.com/goodbye-wittgenstein/">Goodbye Wittgenstien</a> residency while experimenting with new ways to render photographic data. In the studio I was assigned there were some charcoal pencils, a medium I've never dreamed of using. The reason I use cameras and keyboards is I cannot actualise what's in my brain with a pencil. I just lack the motor skills, I guess. But I can trace, so I projected my composite image on the wall and traced every detail. The process was fascinating as I was acting in a completely mindless way, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotter">plotter printer</a>.</p>

<p>The resulting work was framed next to the original digital image in my section of our group exhibition. A lot of my work was algorithmic, in the sense that I was pushing stuff through a computational process to see what it would keep and discard (the original in this case was created by using Photoshop to merge lots of very different photos with the focus-stacking algorithm (<a href="http://art.peteashton.com/auto-blending-2016/">see also</a>)) and here I was using my self as a computation process. I see the shape, I move my hand to trace the shape. It becomes a very mechanical movement with little conscious thought, but the glitches and errors betray my character and humanity. Maybe. </p>

<p>This reminded me of a writing class run by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Goldsmith">Ken Goldsmith</a> which he described in an interview I now can't find, but the gist is he asked his students to copy a text word for word. In the process they made mistakes and errors. These errors were the interesting bit. He also talks <a href="http://www.theskinny.co.uk/things-to-do/heads-up/kenneth-goldsmith-on-uncreative-writing">in this interview</a> about how &quot;if you and I were to transcribe an identical conversation we would transcribe it completely differently. And so this is a validation of this kind of writing: people say that this isn’t writing; it’s merely transcription; but in fact it is very unique and individual writing.&quot; Goldsmith is a prankster, but he's a very serious one and he's on to something here. </p>

<p>What is this sort of thing illuminating? In everyday activities we often perform mechanical gestures - think of swiping an RFID card to go through a turnstile or driving a car - but everyone does them differently. In fact, the more mechanical the gesture, the more someone's personality can be revealed. Our personality is in many ways keyed up to how we interact with the objects of the world, be it the creases left on a paperback book or the smudges on a touchscreen. </p>

<p>As a data-artist (which I define as any artist who uses a computer at some point in their work) I construct systems through which data flows and is shaped. The data-flow for one of my photographs is usually Camera Settings &gt; Sensor &gt; RAW file &gt; Macbook &gt; Lightroom &gt; JPEG &gt; Internet &gt; Screens with each stage seeing transformations of the data. But before the photograph there's non-electronic data flow informed by the space I'm in: the light in that space, my location and position in that space, etc. Then there's the camera itself which radically defines the sort of photography I'm allowed to do (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilém_Flusser#Philosophy_of_photography">Vilém Flusser</a> for more on this). And finally there's the data-flow inside my brain leading me to decide what to photograph and how, informed by my mood, my ideas, my memories of the past and imaginations of the future. All of this is part of the system, part of the flow of making a picture. Why do we separate the human, mechanical and data parts so rigorously? Would it be interesting to blur them up a bit? </p>

<p>In essence, technology doesn't dehumanise. Rather it serves as an abstraction tool to reveal the nuances of humanity. So let's put humans in the middle of otherwise mechanical systems and see what happens. </p>
